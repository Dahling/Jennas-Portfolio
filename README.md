## Description

_This is my portfolio. The purpose of this portfolio is to allow the user to see my accomplishments: various respositories that were created on GitHub, during my first week at Epicodus; a personal picture; an 'about me' section; thumbnails that link to various pieces of work I've done, outside of Epicodus; education and work history; and, lastly, skills and interests._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this Repository onto your Desktop_
* _Open up the HTML file in the web browser of your choosing_
* _You may also look at this project via gh pages_
* _Simple and Sweet_
* _Hope you have a lovely day_


## Known Bugs

_There are no known bugs, except for one (which you may find when looking at the favicon). That's my very favorite type of bug._

## Support and contact details

_If you have any issues, email me, and I will gladly respond._

## Technologies Used

_I used Bootstrap to create this responsive layout, as well as many of Bootstrap's features (e.g., classes, etc.). Other than that I implemented various html and CSS aspects that I've learned during my first week at Epicodus. I also used the Terminal, Git, and GitHub. This was all done on my personal MacBook Air (i.e., my boyfriend)._
